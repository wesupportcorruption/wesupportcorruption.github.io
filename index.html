It is the opinion of the Website Operator that as a result of the actions of the Parliament of South Australia on Thursday, the 23rd of September, 2021, in the passing of the Bill titled "Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (CPIPC Recommendations) Amendment Bill 2021" introduced by Hon Frank Pangallo MLC, that every sitting Member of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly as of the time of the passing of the bill who did not vote against the bill not only endorses misconduct and maladministration within the Parliament of South Australia, but, by narrowing the definition of corruption and removing the ability of the Commissioner to enact investigations on their own perogative also endorses corruption within the Parliament of South Australia.

As no Member of the Legislative Council or the House of Assembly voted against the bill, it is therefore the opinion of the Website Operator that the entire Legislative Council and House of Assembly as of Thursday, the 23rd of September, 2021, endorses misconduct, maladministration and corruption within the Parliament of South Australia.

Below are the Honourable Members of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly who as of Thursday, the 23rd of September, 2021, the Website Operator opines as supporting misconduct, maladministration, and corruption within the Parliament of South Australia and the broader Government of South Australia.

May this website bearing their names stand as a monument to their arrogance and the death of independent Government oversight in South Australia.
