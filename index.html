It is the opinion of the Website Operator that as a result of the actions of the Parliament of South Australia on Thursday, the 23rd of September, 2021, in the passing of the Bill titled "Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (CPIPC Recommendations) Amendment Bill 2021" introduced by Hon Frank Pangallo MLC, that every sitting Member of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly as of the time of the passing of the bill who did not vote against the bill has not only allowed for the increased capacity for misconduct and maladministration within the Parliament of South Australia, but, by narrowing the definition of corruption and removing the ability of the Commissioner to enact investigations on their own prerogative also increases the capacity for corruption within the Parliament of South Australia.
</div>
    <br><br>
<div class="text">
As no Member of the Legislative Council or the House of Assembly voted against the bill, it is therefore the opinion of the Website Operator that the entire Legislative Council and House of Assembly as of Thursday, the 23rd of September, 2021, has implicitly allowed for increased levels of misconduct, maladministration and corruption within the Parliament of South Australia.

Below are the Honourable Members of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly who as of Thursday, the 23rd of September, 2021, the Website Operator opines as implicitly allowing increased levels of misconduct, maladministration, and corruption within the Parliament of South Australia and the broader Government of South Australia.

May this website stand as a monument to their arrogance and the death of independent government oversight in South Australia.
